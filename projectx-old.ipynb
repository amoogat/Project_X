Specifically, it is a \"Vertical Call Spread\" for SPY (S&P 500 ETF) expiring on May 3, 2024.\\n\\nHere's the breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Vertical Call Spread:**\\n   - A vertical spread involves buying and selling two options of the same type (calls or puts) with the same expiration date but different strike prices.\\n   - The trader sells 25 call options with a strike price of 515 and simultaneously buys 25 call options with a strike price of 516.\\n\\n2. **Trade details:**\\n   - For the call options sold (strike price of 515), 25 contracts were sold at \\\\$1.70.\\n   - For the call options bought (strike price of 516), 25 contracts were bought at \\\\$1.40.\\n   - The trader received a net credit of \\\\$0.30 per contract (\\\\$1.70 - \\\\$1.40).\\n\\n3. **Net position:**\\n   - Since the average fill price is -25 @ 0.30, this indicates the trader received a net credit of \\\\$0.30 per spread.\\n\\nIn summary, this image details a credit vertical call spread where the trader is betting that the price of SPY will be below 515 at expiration to keep the credit received.   \n",
